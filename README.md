## Reflection

This was good revision.  The only issue I had with the tutorials it initially walked you in to the string processing direction and halfway though it became clear that a 2D array would be more efficient. 

Even though the integrated theory as you go through each step is great there was none on methods.  A learner with no prior experience would have produced code with alot unecessary of repetition.

So at step 4 of the process I basically started from scrach to incorporate methods and 2D arrays.
It passed all the tests.
